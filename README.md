  Official repo for the lorraine team at hackatown 2020
</h2>

3rd place overall and winning project for "AI and Data Science" category at hackatown2020 ! Bsafe gives you a safe routes between point A and B.

It takes a bunch of information into consideration to give you the safest way to get to a destination. The app shows the user the sectors where crimes happened with red circles to give him/her a good idea of what sector they want to avoid. It also shows the places that are enlightened and has cameras for a better feeling of safety. These sectors are shown with green circles.

The app automatically gives the user the road they might want to take to be safe, but also alternatives if they don't mind about the risks. In fact, in the settings, the user can decide his/her degree of tolerance to danger and our algorithm will consider that.
