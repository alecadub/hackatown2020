</h2>

We were thinking about how we could make a city more friendly for people visiting Montreal. People that don't know where to go and that might end up in places they don't want to, where the crime rates are up, the lightings and the crowdings are down. We wanted everybody to feel safe while they visit the city. This is why we decided to develop a product called Bsafe.

It essentially works like google-map. We thought it would be a great addition to the app. It takes a bunch of information into consideration to give you the safest way to get to a destination. The app shows the user the sectors where crimes happened with red circles to give him/her a good idea of what sector they want to avoid. It also shows the places that are enlightened and has cameras for a better feeling of safety. These sectors are shown with green circles.

The app automatically gives the user the road they might want to take to be safe, but also alternatives if they don't mind about the risks. In fact, in the settings, the user can decide his/her degree of tolerance to danger and our algorithm will consider that.

This project was the 3rd place overall winner and winning project for "AI and Data Science" category at hackatown2020 !
